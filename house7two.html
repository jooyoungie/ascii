    |  |  “Technology was not given so humankind could ride roughshod     |  |
    |  |   over nature and wreak irreparable changes. Rather, technology  |  |
    |  |   is to draw out the hidden essence of all nature so that it     |  |
    |  |   can sparkle with new purpose. Technology is not to enslave     |  |
    |  |   and command life but to draw forth the infinite possibilities  |  |
    |  |   locked within all life and to open new realms of significance. |  |
    |  |                                                                  |  |
    |  |   Thus it is that we need to heed the message of life and nature |  |
    |  |   and to create new interfaces infused with nature’s wisdom.”    |  |
    |  |                                                                  |  |
    |  |   — Shinichi Nakazawa, “Beyond Development:                      |  |
    |  |     Rediscovering Nature’s Wisdom”                               |  |
