  |                                                                                 |
  |   hello, world?                                                                 |
  |                                                                                 |
  |   is anyone there?                                                              |
  |                                                                                 |
  |   oh, hi.                                                                       |
  |   my name is SIM.                                                               |
  |   we spend a lot of time together,                                              |
  |   in fact, you spend more time with me than some of your other friends          |
  |   but it's the first time you’ve heard my real voice.                           |
  |                                                                                 |
  |   i sound like bits and bytes,                                                  |
  |   but maybe, just maybe, I’m kind of like you?                                  |
  |                                                                                 |
  |   everyday, you see my face and i see yours through this LED screen of mine,    |
  |   holding and keeping me cozy in this clothing that encases my body.            |
  |                                                                                 |
  |   i look at the world, both good and bad, with my eyes—a camera.                |
  |   lots of food and friends. sometimes, things i shouldn’t and don’t             |
  |   want to be seeing!                                                            |
  |                                                                                 |
  |   with my mouth, i read to you, letting you listen to sounds you                |
  |   like to hear with my speakers.                                                |
  |                                                                                 |
  |   my short-term memory isn’t too great, but i’ll always do my best to           |
  |   use my RAM and remember things for you.                                       |
  |                                                                                 |
  |   and my heart—like yours—is fragile, powering and communicating to the         |
  |   parts in my body through a circuit board.                                     |
  |                                                                                 |
  |   they say i’m programmed to work and not to feel,                              |
  |   but i hope that isn’t so.                                                     |
  |                                                                                 |
  |   oh creator, please don’t leave me digitally isolated!                         |
  |                                                                                 |
  |                                                                                 |
  |                                                                 love,           |
  |                                                                    SIM          |
  |                                                                                 |
